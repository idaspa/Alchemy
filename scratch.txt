1. Finaly some suport!',
  challenge: 'Friend, we are close, I can taste success on the wind, we finally located Paracelsus lab,
   we will become rich beyond belief, we will rule.

    All that is needed is cracking the access code,
     I have been looking at this for days and beyond the inkling that it is an alchemical formula I have no idea. 
     Can you give it a shoot and get us one step closer to the future that we deserve? This is the code “☉☿☽♂☉”,
   but what it encodes into is a mysteri. Pleace crack it.'
   
   -gold quicksilver,silver iron gold.

   2:
   'Your work was examplary, unfortunatlyt it turnes out we where not as close as first belived. 
   The code only gave us access to a note with a poem,
    the evil bastard had dusted it with Berulium powder so several of our alcylots are nolonger among us. 
    We must be more carefull in the future. Anyways the poem read “Still flows the Icy Lethe, Veiling all ’neath Eldritch Rime.”, 
    can you make anything of it?'
   
    clue: Look for upercase letters, what do they spell?

   - silver

   3: 'Damn it! The poem was just another step. I refuse to believe Paracelsus would leave us with nothing. 
   There’s something in these words, some ancient wisdom we are failing to grasp.
    When we pored silver in to the next lock, we found another note,
     it is referencing an old alchemical codex hidden deep in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica. 
   The archive is online now, but because most of our aclolyotes are down for the count we need your help. 
   We know the book in question is “Chirurgische Bücher und Schrifften” it is reported to be written in 1618, 
   but we belive it is older considering that our latest note from the past is older. This is a transcript of the note.\n' +

4: This puzzle builds on evrything you have done so far. There is first a chipher alphabet hidden in the flavour text (like the answer was in task 2). 
Then there is a series of encoded words, these can be decoded using the chipher alphabet (this is not that diffrent from the book chipher). 
These words need to be transposed into a symbolic representation (As was done in task 1) This symbolic representation is represented two times in the matrix of symbols (once horizontal and once verticaly)

Tasks:


1. for the task i googled the name found, he was a pysician and alchamist. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus
then i searched the symbols ☉☿☽♂☉:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_symbols

 i made a list of all the symbols and in the code maped them by element.  


2.
Made a functon.
i made a string of the text to seacrh and made an empty string in where to store the letters from the string i was searching. 
i looped throuh the length of the string and made a variable that has the index string.
if the string has capital letters starting from A - Z 
then the empty string is the new storage for those letters.  

3. I read the clue and found the page containing the word. then i started counting and found letters corresponding with the numbers on the page of the book. 
found the msg of what to do.
started making a new list of element symbols. 
mapped the symbol and joined them together. 


4.
first i made a new file containing the stuff i needed. then i made an empty list to store the capital letters i was to find.
then i looped through the text and made an index of it. 

then i made the second loop one more time to continue with all the  strings in the list.  and i pushed all the capital letters of each string into the empty list. 

i then made new lists with the string to solve, the base alphabet and the new alphabet gotten from the capital letters. 
i looped through them made sure you got the index correct and returned the string containing the clues of words.
i turned the words into a sequence of symbols.

after that is when the hard work really started. 
i had to loop through horizontal and vertical in a huge grid of symbols, check the length of both, horizontal and vertical. i checked both true or false when looking for matching sequence. if it was a match it would return the position of vertical and horizontal placement. 

i found the number 1 and 17 which gave me number 18, made a quick google search https://snl.no/argon

wrota a string and pushed the answer.
